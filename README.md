# Telecom Call Data Analytics

## Overview
This project focuses on the analysis of raw Call Detail Records (CDR) data from a telecom network. The initial dataset comprises 435 columns and 17,000 rows of unstructured data. Using Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy, the data has been processed and cleaned, organizing it into a more structured and usable format.

## Data Cleaning Process
The data cleaning process involved handling missing values, standardizing formats, and organizing the information to enhance its readability. Pandas and NumPy were instrumental in efficiently managing and transforming the data into a more organized structure.

## Visualizations
The cleaned dataset serves as the foundation for creating insightful visualizations using popular data visualization libraries such as Matplotlib and Plotly. The visualizations include:

- **Total Incoming and Outgoing Calls**: Graphical representation of the distribution of incoming and outgoing calls over time.

- **Call Data Analysis**: Visual insights into call patterns, durations, and frequencies to identify trends and outliers.

- **Service Data Exploration**: Visualization of service-related data to understand usage patterns and preferences.
